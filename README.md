# opengate
A homebrew open source gate entry system.

## Gate Systems

A gate system has 3 components.

* gate: the controlled barrier
* gate opener: the motor that opens/closes the gate
* gate entry system: the keypad/camera/telephone to control access

A person who wants access approaches the entry system and:

* enters a security code: if the code is correct they are granted access. 
* calls a designated person(s): if the called person grants access they send some dtmf tones to open the gate.


## Problem

Gate entry systems are expensive to buy, install and operate.

* Hardware $2000 
* Installation $2000
* Connectivity $50/month
* Service $30/month

In my case the gate system came with the property and uses a land line for connectivity.
The only reason I need a land line is for the gate system. This costs around $160/month.
